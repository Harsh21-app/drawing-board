🧩 Drawing Board App
A Flutter application that allows users to draw shapes (Circle, Square, Rectangle) and interactively replace them by tapping — each shape remembers its history and replaces itself with earlier shapes in the insertion queue.

✨ Features
✅ Add shapes to the drawing board via buttons

✅ Tap any shape to replace it with a previous one from the insertion history

✅ Shape is removed when its history is exhausted

✅ Uses Flutter's native StatefulWidget — no third-party state management

✅ Clean architecture with separate files for models, screens, and widgets

✅ Latest Flutter version compatible (3.19+)

📁 Project Structure
bash

├── main.dart                   # Entry point
├── models/
│   └── shape.dart              # Shape model and enum
├── screens/
│   └── drawing_board_screen.dart  # Main screen with board logic
├── widgets/

│   └── shape_widget.dart       # Shape display widget
🧱 Architectural Choices
✅ Componentization
The UI is modular:

ShapeWidget → renders a specific shape

ShapeButton → renders a button based on shape type

✅ Stateless vs Stateful
StatefulWidget is used only where necessary (DrawingBoardScreen)

Reusable parts are kept Stateless

✅ Shape Replacement Logic
Each shape stores:

insertionIndex: the index in the global shape history

tapCount: number of times it was tapped Logic ensures the shape walks backward in history until no more options are left, then deletes itself.

🧩 How to Run the Application
Install Flutter
Follow the official guide: Flutter install

Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repo-url>

✅ You’re done! The app should load with three shape buttons and an interactive drawing board.

📦 Third-Party Libraries
🚫 None used. The app uses pure Flutter, no Provider, GetX, or state libraries — keeping things minimal and readable.
